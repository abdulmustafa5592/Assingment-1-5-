               <h1><b><i>Nature</i></b></h1>
        <p><i><a href="">Nature</a> in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</i></p>
        <h3>Types Of Nature</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Mountains</li>
                <li> Forests </li>
                <li> Oceans</li>
            </ul>
        <h2><b><i> Mountains</i></b></h2>
   <p><i> A <a href="">Mountains</a> is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (980 ft) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.</i></p>
    <h3> Types of Mountains:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Volcanic</li>
        <li> Fold</li>
        <li> Plateau</li>
        <li> Fault-block</li>
        <li> Dome</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Volcanic Mountains</h4>
    <p><i><b><a href=""> Volcanic Mountain</b></a> is a cinder cone in central Yukon Territory, Canada, located a short distance north of Fort Selkirk, near the confluence of the Pelly and Yukon Rivers. Volcano Mountain is called Nelrúna in the Northern Tutchone language.</i></p>
    <h4>fold Mountains</h4>
    <p><i><b><a href=""></b>Fold Mountains</a> are formed by the effects of folding on layers within the upper part of the Earth's crust. Before the development of the theory of plate tectonics and before the internal architecture of thrust belts became well understood, the term was used to describe most mountain belts but has otherwise fallen out of use.</i></p>
    <h4>Plateau Mountains</h4>
    <p><i><b><a href=""></b>Plateau Mountain</b></a> is located in the town of Hunter in Greene County, New York, United States. It is part of the Devil's Path range of the Catskill Mountains. Plateau has a two-mile-long (3.2 km) summit ridge above 3,500 feet (1,100 m). The highest point, at least 3,840 feet (1,170 m), is at the southeast end, facing Sugarloaf Mountain to the east across Mink Hollow Notch. It is the 12th-highest peak in the range Devils Tombstone is located west of Plateau Mountain. The northwest end faces Hunter Mountain to the west across 1,400-foot deep (430 m) Stony Clove Notch.</i></p>
<h4>Fault-Block</h4>
<p><i><b><a href="">Fault-Block</b></a> mountains often result from rifting, an indicator of extensional tectonics. These can be small or form extensive rift valley systems, such as the East African Rift zone. Death Valley in California is a smaller example. There are two main types of block mountains; uplifted blocks between two faults and tilted blocks mainly controlled by one fault.</i></p>
<h4>Dome</h4>
<p><i><b><a href="">Round Mountain</b></a>is a mountain in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, located 22 km (14 mi) east of Dease Lake.
    Round Mountain is a volcanic feature of the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that formed in the past 1.6 million years of the Pleistocene</i></p>
    <h2><b><i>Forests</i></b></h2>
<p><i><a href="">Forests</a>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.[1] Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function.[2][3][4] The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use."[5] Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7 million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020</i></p>
<h3><i> Types of Forests:</i></h3>
<p><i>
    <ul>
        <li>Temperate Forest</li>
        <li>Tropical rainforest</li>
        <li>Trolpical Forest</li>
        <li>SubTropical Forest</li>
    </ul>
</i></p>
<h4>Temperate Forest</h4>
<p><i><a href=""></a>A temperate forest is a forest found between the tropical and boreal regions, located in the temperate zone. It is the second largest biome on our planet, covering 25%[1] of the world's forest area, only behind the boreal forest, which covers about 33%. These forests cover both hemispheres at latitudes ranging from 25 to 50 degrees,[2] wrapping the planet in a belt similar to that of the boreal forest. Due to its large size spanning several continents, there are several main types: deciduous, coniferous, mixed forest, and rainforest.</i></p>
<h4>Tropical Forests</h4>
<p><i><a href=""></a>Tropical forests are forested landscapes in tropical regions: i.e. land areas approximately bounded by the tropic of Cancer and Capricorn, but possibly affected by other factors such as prevailing winds.
    Borneo rainforest
    Some tropical forest types are difficult to categorize. While forests in temperate areas are readily categorized on the basis of tree canopy density, such schemes do not work well in tropical forests.[1] There is no single scheme that defines what a forest is, in tropical regions or elsewhere.</i></p>
    <h4>Tropical RainForests</h4>
    <p><i><a href=""></a>Tropical rainforests are rainforests that occur in areas of tropical rainforest climate in which there is no dry season – all months have an average precipitation of at least 60 mm – and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. True rainforests are typically found between 10 degrees north and south of the equator (see map); they are a sub-set of the tropical forest biome that occurs roughly within the 28-degree latitudes (in the equatorial zone between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are a type of tropical moist broadleaf forest (or tropical wet forest) that also includes the more extensive seasonal tropical forests.</i></p>
    <h4>SubTropical Forests</h4>
    <p><i><a href="">Subtropical Forests</a> are home to more species than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth: Half of the world's species may live in these forests, where a square kilometer may be home to more than 1,000 tree species. These forests are found around the world, particularly in the Indo-Malayan Archipelago, the Amazon Basin, and the African Congo Basin.</i></p>
